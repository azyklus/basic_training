   Moving forward, most of the contents of this document will involve simple demonstrations and sometimes interactive lessons in programming with C, Python,
   and potentially some Bash/PowerShell scripting. Having your text editor and your CLI open will be most helpful if you intend to follow along with each
   figure in the document.
