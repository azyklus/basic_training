\section{Programming Languages}
\paragraph{}
   Although this report will focus mostly on the C programming language, we will discuss and use concepts from other languages like Python, Rust, C\#,
   and others.

   The C programming language is widely considered to be the father of modern programming languages and programming language theory. Learning C is
   probably the best way to become a successful programmer and can massively benefit you in the long term as learning C introduces you to concepts
   that are heavily utilized in the world of computer science.

   Languages like Python, however, offer much of the same in that regard. Python is heavily used in data science and mathematics as the goto language
   for said fields because of its concise syntax and gargantuan ecosystem where modules and packages are concerned.

   Rust is a very new language, relatively speaking. Having been created in 2010 by Graydon Hoare at Mozilla, it solves quite a few problems that've
   emerged through rigorous usage of languages like C over the years. One such problem would be memory management. In C, mistakes in memory management
   can often be made without ever even realizing what you've done. Rust solves this by implementing a set of syntax rules like borrow-checking, which
   frees unused memory the instant it goes out of scope. The methods that the Rust language employs to rid programs of memory-related bugs and
   problems are novel, and time will tell if they hold up to their intended purpose.
